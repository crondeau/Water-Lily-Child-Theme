 * To make changes you need to find the CSS you want to modify from the parent theme
 * copy it from the parent into this file
 * make your changes and save them. 
 * Once the child theme is installed and activated the theme will read the CSS of the parent
 * and then read your changes. 
 * Below is an example of how you would change the link colour.
 * 
 * You can also make changes to template files
 * Copy the PHP template from the parent and make the changes to the PHP template in your child theme.
